[**DragonRuby Game Toolkit**](https://dragonruby.org/toolkit/game) is a commercial-grade, yet beginner-friendly, [**open soruce**](https://github.com/dragonruby/dragonruby-game-toolkit-contrib/) 2D game engine. It's tiny, fast, and cross-platform.
You can play around with the engine using our [**Online Sandbox**](http://fiddle.dragonruby.org.s3-website.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/).
The source code for the sandbox is available on [**GitHub**](https://github.com/DragonRuby/fiddle.dragonruby.org) if you want to run a local instance of the website.
