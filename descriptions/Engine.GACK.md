[**G.A.C.K.**](http://gack.glbasic.com/), or Gaming App Construction Kit, is a very easy to use game maker that features a lot of possibilities without requiring any programming.  started as a competition entry to build a S.E.U.C.K. remake, based on the C64 original. Since then, many changes have been added so the workflow is easier to understand and more comfortable. With the current version G.A.C.K. is a lot more than just a remake. It's a fully featured game maker with export options for many target platforms.
